Minecraft Bukkit Plugin for Geographic-Map Import, Image Import and quick Building
This Pluin is designed to import a geographic map image into the ground of a minecraft 
map so you can see where to place a wall of a pathway. So you dont have to measure and calculate
to build a real world place.
Its also possible to import your own drawn fantasy map of your building or town.
The import is up to now i Pixel = 1 Block. I will change that!
Another feature is the import of images into minecraft. You can define a directory from where you can 
import images into your minecraft world. The images can be in placed on the ground or standing upright.
For clearing frames of the images i implemented a block delete function thet deletes all blocks of a clicked blocks color.
Some quickbuild funktions are include too.
